    <p class="iframe">My name is Zefu Li. I will finish high school and go to college next year. I am attending a tech program named dev.mission in this summer, and this program gives me a chance to have this corporate site visit. I think I am really getting into this tech environment. I am developing my ability to solve problems at school, especially in mathematics; I figure that my skills of solving problems in mathematics are actually useful when I am doing coding exercises at home, and that really gets me excited because I want to pursue a career in tech industry. I know that working in tech industry could be a challenge but I like to take challenges, to solve problems. Also, another challenge for me is to share this passion at school, not many students are interested in coding club and what I am doing is simply sharing my skills with them or telling them they should learn more about technology; I really want to create a tech environment at school which everyone could share the same passion. So I am here to learn how to create that environment, and I think you can share your thoughts about working in this tech environment.</p>
